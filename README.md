Yunjun's comments:


This capability is not difficult on each single case, but (I think) it's tedious to design an adaptable code for pretty figures with a general dataset in mind. I don't have time to do this type of coding anymore unfortunately.

Again, one could use mintpy.view.prep/plot_slice() to leverage the existing capability, and still matplotlib as simple or complicated as they like.
